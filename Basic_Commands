Below are the basic commands required for working with Mongodb

Database Name will be Test1,
Collection Name will be prac.


List of All Docs: db.prac.find( {} )
Add .preety() for structured output.




* I have been working with Nested Documents, which i had no idea on how to filter/find in sub Documents, here's how to do it:

Use . (dot) for every sub-document.
eg, if we have a doc names country, within it a sub-doc named states, with in it is city, then to find/search query in city doc, 
db.prac.find ( { 'country.states,city' : "Pune" } )
Now the major point is to use single quote with key and double quote with value.
